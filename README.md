Women Clothes Prediction using Multinomial Naive Bayes
ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
This project aims to predict women's clothing ratings based on customer reviews using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classification algorithm. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on customer review texts, the model can estimate the likelihood of a clothing item receiving a particular rating.

The dataset used in this project comes from the Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews Dataset available publicly on GitHub.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The main goal is to:

Predict customer ratings based on their written reviews.

Classify review text into numerical rating categories (1 to 5 stars).

Provide a baseline text classification model using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
